# predicting heart disease using logistic and K nearest neighbors

This project uses logistic regression on the [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication) training dataset using Python and libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit, matplotlib, and seaborn

## Objective

To use the dataset given to perform logistic and K nearest neighbor models to predict if someone has heart disease

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle
- Format: CSV
- Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication)
  
## Key Features
- Scatterplots
- Linear regression
- confusion matrices
- accuracy score

## Skills practiced

- Real world dataset handling
- visualization with seaborn/matplotlib
- Data Wrangling with pandas
- performing logistic regression and K nearest neighbor using scikitlearn
- finding acccuracy score and creating a confusion matrix using scikitlearn

## How to Run

1. Open the juypter note book or run in google collab
2. All cells are able to be executed as is
3. go in to the kaggle link that is given and download train.csv and added it to juypter notebook or google collab
4. run the code
